Hi Katie,

As part of my analysis, I identified several data integrity challenges that
impact how well we can use the dataset, as well as a key growth insight
that may be valuable for Fetch.
*Data Quality Challenges**1. Missing Data (Users & Products)*

A significant portion of user and product data is incomplete:

   - *Users*: Many records are missing birth_date, state, language, and
   gender, limiting segmentation and demographic insights.
   - *Products*: A large number of records have placeholder or missing
   values in brand and manufacturer, and many products lack full category
   classifications, making it difficult to accurately analyze brand
   performance, category trends, and product-level sales insights.

Should we extrapolate missing user demographics and product information
based on available distributions, or exclude them from certain analyses?

Is there some way we can incentivize our users to supply more data?  Maybe
extra rewards for uploading a valid ID?
*2. Data That Doesn=E2=80=99t Cross-Reference Between Tables*

One of the biggest challenges is that many transaction records reference
user_ids or barcodes that don=E2=80=99t appear in the users or products tab=
les.
This makes it difficult to fully analyze user behavior and product sales
trends.

Are there steps we can take to ensure transactions reference valid users
and products?

How frequently do we update our user and product information, and could an
update help resolve these gaps?
*3. Investigating Duplicate Transactions*

Roughly half of all transactions appear to be duplicates, with one version
containing valid data and the other containing "zero" quantities or missing
sales values. This suggests an issue occurring at the data ingestion stage.

Would it be possible to review how transactions are recorded and ingested
to understand why these duplicates are created?


*Key Finding: Strong User Growth with Opportunities to Improve Engagement*

The total user base continues to grow, which is a great sign. However,
year-over-year growth has slowed slightly compared to previous years. One
way to reaccelerate engagement may be through demographic insights=E2=80=94=
for
example, we see that women aged 35-44 scan more receipts than any other
group. If Fetch isn=E2=80=99t already leveraging targeted engagement strate=
gies for
this segment, this could be an opportunity to enhance retention and
increase spending.

Would love to hear your thoughts on how best to proceed with these
findings. Let me know how I can help.


Thanks,

- Chris Blazer
